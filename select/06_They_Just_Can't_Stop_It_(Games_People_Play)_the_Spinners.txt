Can't get no rest, don't know how I work all day
When will I learn? Memories get in the way
I walk around, I can't hear a sound, folks talkin' loud
But I don't see at all, I gotta get away, gotta get away
I don't know where to go, it's hopeless so I guess I'll leave it alone

Well, I spent all the day fixin' up to go somewhere
Thought I was late and I found she wasn't there
I guess I'll find the love, peace of mind some other time
But I still have today, I gotta get away, gotta get away
I don't know where to go, it's hopeless so I guess I'll leave it alone

Games people play, night or day, they're just not matchin'
What they should do, keeps me feelin' blue
Been down too long, right, wrong, I just can't stop it
Spendin' all day, thinkin' just of you

Twelve forty-five, headed for the subway home
I took my time 'cause I felt so all alone
Not far away I heard a funny sound, took a look around
And I could see her face smile as she came, callin' out my name
So I know where to go, we'll take it slow but guess I'll call it a day

Games people play, night or day they're just not matchin'
What they should do, keeps me feelin' blue
Been down too long, right, wrong, I just can't stop it
Spendin' all day, thinkin' just of you

Games people play, night or day they're just not matchin'
What they should do, keeps me feelin' blue
