[00:28.31] Can't get no rest
[00:30.87] Don't know how I work all day
[00:33.90] When will I learn?
[00:37.25] Memories get in the way
[00:48.75] 
[00:40.14] I walk around
[00:43.25] I can't hear a sound
[00:45.07] Folks talkin' loud
[00:46.67] But I don't see at all
[00:49.24] I gotta get away, gotta get away
[01:05.24] 
[00:52.67] I don't know where to go
[00:55.97] It's hopeless so
[00:58.88] I guess I'll leave it alone
[01:12.38] 
[01:03.13] Well, I spent all the day
[01:06.04] Fixin' up to go somewhere
[01:09.58] Thought I was late
[01:13.16] And I found she wasn't there
[01:27.16] 
[01:16.12] I guess I'll find
[01:19.47] The love, peace of mind, some other time
[01:22.22] But I still have today
[01:25.66] I gotta get away, gotta get away
[01:41.66] 
[01:29.00] I don't know where to go
[01:32.67] It's hopeless so
[01:34.93] I guess I'll leave it alone
[01:48.43] 
[01:39.46] Games people play
[01:42.66] Night or day
[01:44.41] They're just not matchin'
[01:46.79] What they should do
[01:48.83] Keeps me feelin' blue
[01:59.33] 
[01:53.92] Been down too long
[01:57.27] Right, wrong
[01:59.02] I just can't stop it
[02:00.93] Spendin' all day
[02:03.34] Thinking just of you
[02:13.34] 
[02:08.94] 12: 45
[02:14.39] Headed for the subway home
[02:18.39] I took my time
[02:21.19] 'Cause I felt so all alone
[02:34.19] 
[02:24.36] Not far away
[02:26.96] I heard a funny sound, took a look around
[02:30.03] And I could see her face
[02:33.24] Smilin' as she came
[02:35.34] Callin' out my name
[02:44.84] 
[02:36.72] So I know where to go
[02:39.67] We'll take it slow
[02:42.58] Guess I'll call it a day
[02:54.58] 
[02:48.20] Games people play
[02:50.64] Night or day
[02:52.30] They're just not matchin'
[02:54.67] What they should do
[02:57.06] Keeps me feelin' blue
[03:07.56] 
[03:02.47] Been down too long
[03:05.17] Right, wrong
[03:07.03] I just can't stop it
[03:09.10] Spendin' all day
[03:11.53] Thinking just of you
[03:21.53] 
[03:17.50] Games people play
[03:20.32] Night or day
[03:21.83] They're just not matchin'
[03:23.54] What they should do
[03:27.74] Keeps me feelin' blue
