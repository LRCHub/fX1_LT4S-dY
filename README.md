Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

One the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean, yeah
And they wile away the hours
In their ivory towers
'Till they covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine, yeah

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Talking about you and me
And the games people play

Oh, we make one another cry
Break a heart and we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die
That the other was to blame, yeah
Neither one will give in
So we gaze at our eight by ten
Thinking about the things that might have been
It's a dirty rotten shame, yeah

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Talking about you and me
And the games people play, yeah

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Talking about you and me
And the games people play

The games people play
The games people play
The games people play
The games people play

Look around tell me what you see
What's happening to you and me
God bring me the serenity
To remember who I am
'Cause you've given up your sanity
For your pride and your vanity
Turns you sad on humanity
And you don't give a na na na na na na

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Talking about you and me
And the games people play, yeah

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Talking about you and me
And the games people play

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Talking about you and me
And the games people play, yeah
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Talking about you and me
And the games people play
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Talking about you and me
And the games people play
